# Bethe-Functions

What is this?
----
This is an open source GitHub repository containing code for the functions introduced in (link arxiv paper here) related to the Bethe Ansatz for the Heisenberg-Ising (XXZ) Spin-1/2 chain. You will find code which contains definitions for the functions themselves along with code to generate plots for observables of the model (only the one-point function for now). 

Why?
---
* Provide source code for the plots and numerical evidence for the conjectures found in (link arxiv paper here)
* Advance research and simulation in the fields relating to the Bethe Ansatz and XXZ spin chain by providing open source access to relevant code
